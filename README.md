Public resources for the book **"Team Guide to Metrics for Business Decisions"** (https://skeltonthatcher.com/publications/team-guide-metrics-business-decisions)

## Example Spreadsheets
We have created some example spreadsheets to demonstrate what we are talking about in the book. Feel free to use them, copy them, edit them as you like - they should help you get started with metrics for your business decisions!

You can find them all in this public folder in google drive: [example spreadsheets](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2p8TYBgYF-MSkx2ZUt6SGxTY3c) 
_(note: the examples are a read-only version. In order to use them use the menu "File/Make a copy" to copy them)_

The folder contains the following spreadsheets:
* [Are my story points predictable?](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rfrr9ZoUjlIQS8hxCKjTx9r9ndvwcDZ9zHgd_T17rIE) Many teams rely on story points to give them predictability and answer questions like _"How long will this story take? When are we going to complete these stories? How much can we achieve in the next two weeks?"_. But is that really giving you any predictability? Use this spreadsheet to verify whether there is correlation between your estimates (story points) and how long stories actually take (lead time).
