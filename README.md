Public resources for the book **"Team Guide to Metrics for Business Decisions"** (https://skeltonthatcher.com/publications/team-guide-metrics-business-decisions)

## Example Spreadsheets
We have created some example spreadsheets to demonstrate what we are talking about in the book. Feel free to use them, copy them, edit them as you like - they should help you get started with metrics for your business decisions!

You can find them all in this public folder in google drive: [example spreadsheets](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2p8TYBgYF-MSkx2ZUt6SGxTY3c) 

The folder contains the following spreadsheets:
* [Are my story points predictable?](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rfrr9ZoUjlIQS8hxCKjTx9r9ndvwcDZ9zHgd_T17rIE) Many teams rely on story points to give them predictability and answer questions like _"How long will this story take? When are we going to complete these stories? How much can we achieve in the next two weeks?"_. But is that really giving you any predictability? Use this spreadsheet to verify whether there is correlation between your estimates (story points) and how long stories actually take (lead time). 
* [Throughput - Stats & Trend](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JyTEYg3vIh0OoPM_TSwzPNGn_cXYGsBMFXT2SnF5Tg0) Find out how many stories you're completing in each iteration/sprint and analyse your data to make better business decisions. Answer questions like _"How many stories can we complete in the next iteration?"_ and _"Are we improving?"_
* [Throughput - Simple Project Forecasting](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13NdAyShAsAuKZZFITg2w3dznQN6wTHIyW7vkhmtmdPQ) Use your throughput to make simple predictions and answer questions like _"When will this project/functionality be done?"_ and _"Which stories can we complete in the next iteration?"_

_(note: the examples are a read-only version. In order to use them use the menu "File/Make a copy" to copy them)_

## Example Trello board
* [Example Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/fq07LbFO/bizmetrics-book-example-board) We have created an example Trello board that demonstrates how you can track information for your stories, including the sprint when they were completed to easily calculate your Throughput.
